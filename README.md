# GameOfLife
A clean game of life, done the algorithmic way. 

This game of life is a simple and elegant C# console application

##Why C#?
C# 4.7.2 is the core of the project. Dependency Injection is done with Ninject.
And everything you'll see will respect the SOLID principles and the clean-code principle.
